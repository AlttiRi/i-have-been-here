# [i-have-been-here](https://github.com/AlttiRi/i-have-been-here)

The old demo extension that I use for some tests.

The most useful things that it does:
- screenshots downloading (also, screenshots saving)
- visits (it's something like bookmarks)

Currently, in development. In plans to do a bookmarks manager.
